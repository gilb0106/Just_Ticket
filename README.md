Just Ticket

Just Ticket is a simple ticking system with two basic roles Agent and Customer. An Agent can view all tickets, update tickets, query tickets, and update the state of a ticket.
A customer can only see the tickets they created and have the ability to create new tickets. While customers may update tickets they cannot change ticket states.
